#gulp boilerplate

a boilerplate for gulp files!

* static server with automatic live reload
* jade compilation
* stylus compilation
* coffeescript compilation

The aim is to get you up and running with something in _gulp_ quickly

##usage
as a prerequisite it's assumed you have `npm` installed and the `gulp-cli`.

1. clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/jh3y/gulp-boilerplate.git

2. install dependencies

    npm install

3. start gulp

    gulp

4. start hacking away with super fast livereload goodness.

Any problems or questions, feel free to post an issue or tweet me, @_jh3y!
